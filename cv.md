### About myself 
Iâ€™m working in a polyclinic as an electronic engineer. In my case, this is the same as an anykey worker and a bit of a system administrator. I am good at computer science. I have graduated from the Belarusian National Technical University and now enrolled in the RSSchool frontend course. I believe that my skills and knowledge will help me go through this path and become a good Frontend Developer.
